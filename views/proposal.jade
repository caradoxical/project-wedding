  p You wake up in darkness, with a hint of light bleeding from underneath the door. Your sense of time isn't well adjusted after a flight across the Pacific, a 4am landing (local time, of course) and a day of sightseeing. It could be 7am or 7pm as far as you know. Check the clock! Nice. 8:30am, not too late at all. Let's get going, big guy, you've got quite a day ahead of you. Your feet fall hard onto the heated wooden floors, unsteady from either too much or too little sleep.
  p The thought of prepackaged iced coffee pull you through the darkness towards the fridge in your kitchenette. Let's pull out two coffees (keopi tu you excitedly whisper to yourself in a Korean accent), some milk and two bowls of some sort of Frosted Flakes-style cereal. They're great. Your tv only shows two kinds of channels, K-pop and sumo wrestling. She sits down on the couch beside you and grabs her bowl of flakes while you both watch 8 androgynous Korean youths sing and dance to syrupy-sweet pop music while their 12-15 year-old female fans shriek with delight. You obviously start tapping your foot and the song gets stuck in your head, despite not really understanding any of it.
  p Shower, change, pack. Map? Check. Camera? Check. The ring? Check. Double check. Triple check. Check. Aight, you're ready to get out of here.
  p You're walking up a gentle slope towards the gondola to the tallest point in Seoul. Your feet are killing you. While stylish, the Toms you won last November for having the "Lamest Mustache in Washington DC" do not provide a lot of support. Suck it up, bro, you've got a lot more walking to do.
  p Seoul is huge! The two of you can see for miles in every direction and there are buildings as far as you can see. Seoul is surrounded by dark mountains and blanketed in a heavy haze. It's beautiful, in a desolate sort of way. Perfect time to get lunch on top of Seoul Tower, let's just go get some cash from the ATM nearby. W T F... What do you mean you can't withdraw any funds from your account? $50 in phone calls later (and some cursing under your breath) things have not improved. @#%$ing Bank of America is the worst institution on earth. You use the last of your Korean Won to pay for a elevator ride up 20 stories for the two of you to eat a fancy Korean buffet. You think it was pretty tasty, but you've had better. You hope you can find another way to get money soon!
  p Now that you've completed your obligatory tourist activity, you're ready for the final round. You guide her towards Gyongbokgung palace via Seoul's pristine subway. This city is pretty boss, you think, you could totally move here. For the umpthteen time in your life you wish you had been better at planning things, as you're so close to the destination you imaged proposing at, but have no idea where to go now. Isn't there a lake-thing somewhere nearby?
  p You rush her through the Korean museum. You incidentally learn that Koreans have been using moveable-type since like 1200 AD. Why does Gutenberg get so much attention when he's like 250 years late to the printing party? You're out of the museum walking through the gardens of Korea's largest and most opulent palace at a blistering speed. She asks you to slow down a bit, so you check your pace for a few minutes, then speed right back up. You've got to find that lake-thing! Finally, after what feels like miles of walking, you see it! Some sort of big pagoda structure right on a reflecting pond! Its just like in the pictures, so you try to rush her to the far end of the reflecting pool so that the pictures you take at the end will be the most awesome.
  p Your plan has been foiled as she finds a bench to sit on near the side of the pond. You've dragged her around far enough, it's probably time to stop. It's now or never.
  p "Take a picture of the building!" she says, and starts rooting through your camera bag. Not your camera bag! That's where you are obviously keeping the ring...this can't happen. You grab the bag from her rather forcefully and pretend that you're messing around with lenses and stuff. You're not really messing with lenses, but trying to pull the ring box out of it's outer box, but it's not cooperating. "Come on," you telepathically tell the box. Success! You kneel down and ask her, "Kateleigh Hewins, will you marry me?"
